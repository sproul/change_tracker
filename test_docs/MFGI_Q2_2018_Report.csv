"Dear Shareholder,",
"",
"I am pleased to report a tremendous second quarter for Merchants Financial Group, Inc.",
"(MFGI), with strong earnings and progress on a number of strategic initiatives. Every one of our Bank",
Regions and our Merchants Bank Equipment Finance division exceeded its respective income plan for,
"the first half of the year, contributing to consolidated net income at mid-year of $9,152,505. This",
performance is $2.1 million ahead of plan and an increase of 53.51% compared to 2017 second quarter,
earnings.,
"",
Some of the biggest contributors to our success through two quarters include:,
" Generation of new commercial loans exceeding $145 million; fee income on commercial",
"loan activity exceeded $1 million, virtually double what we had forecast",
" Residential mortgage lending of $170 million; that volume put us at 95% of our mid-year",
"goal, but strong pricing management has driven mortgage income that is $550,000 over",
plan,
" Continued prudent focus on credit quality; Classified and Criticized loans at mid-year were",
8.60% of total loans (within our benchmark target of 10%); non-performing loans remain,
"elevated at 1.89% (our target is 1%), primarily driven by continued stress in the ag",
economy; Past due loans are at negligible at .25% of loans and net charge-offs are at just,
".05%",
" Intense monitoring and mitigation of the risk in the consolidated loan portfolio, which has",
included some restructuring associated with problem credits and utilization of loan,
guarantee programs; this allowed us to reverse some Allowance for Loan/Lease Loss,
Reserves (ALLR) again at the second quarter -- total Reserves remain healthy at 1.54% of,
"all loans, but through the first six months of 2018, Reserves contribution has been $2.7",
million less than our 2017 contribution at mid-year,
"",
Our new loan activity has basically replaced run-off and year-over-year deposit growth has been,
"$25 million. We continue to be intensely focused on liquidity management and are especially focused",
on core deposit growth in order to meet future demand for new loans and allow us to meet our profitable,
growth objectives.,
"",
"To facilitate deposit growth, we will be offering two Certificate of Deposit specials effective",
"August 1, but wanted to make you aware of them ahead of time. Enclosed you will find detailed",
"information about these offerings. We value your loyalty as a Shareholder, and appreciate your banking",
"business as well. Please take advantage of these special rates, and pass the information along to your",
friends and family members.,
"",
"As always, the most significant driver of our success is the commitment we make to delivering a",
differentiated service experience to our clients. As the competition in the banking industry continues to,
"grow even more intense, I want you to know how grateful we are for your support. Im looking forward to",
continuing the momentum weve had in the beginning of 2018 through the remainder of the year.,

"","Very truly yours,"
