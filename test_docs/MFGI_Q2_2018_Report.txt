Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to report a tremendous second quarter for Merchants Financial Group, Inc.
(MFGI), with strong earnings and progress on a number of strategic initiatives. Every one of our Bank
Regions and our Merchants Bank Equipment Finance division exceeded its respective income plan for
the first half of the year, contributing to consolidated net income at mid-year of $9,152,505. This
performance is $2.1 million ahead of plan and an increase of 53.51% compared to 2017 second quarter
earnings.
Some of the biggest contributors to our success through two quarters include:
• Generation of new commercial loans exceeding $145 million; fee income on commercial
loan activity exceeded $1 million, virtually double what we had forecast
• Residential mortgage lending of $170 million; that volume put us at 95% of our mid-year
goal, but strong pricing management has driven mortgage income that is $550,000 over
plan
• Continued prudent focus on credit quality; Classified and Criticized loans at mid-year were
8.60% of total loans (within our benchmark target of 10%); non-performing loans remain
elevated at 1.89% (our target is 1%), primarily driven by continued stress in the ag
economy; Past due loans are at negligible at .25% of loans and net charge-offs are at just
.05%
• Intense monitoring and mitigation of the risk in the consolidated loan portfolio, which has
included some restructuring associated with problem credits and utilization of loan
guarantee programs; this allowed us to reverse some Allowance for Loan/Lease Loss
Reserves (ALLR) again at the second quarter -- total Reserves remain healthy at 1.54% of
all loans, but through the first six months of 2018, Reserves contribution has been $2.7
million less than our 2017 contribution at mid-year
Our new loan activity has basically replaced run-off and year-over-year deposit growth has been
$25 million. We continue to be intensely focused on liquidity management and are especially focused
on core deposit growth in order to meet future demand for new loans and allow us to meet our profitable
growth objectives.
To facilitate deposit growth, we will be offering two Certificate of Deposit specials effective
August 1, but wanted to make you aware of them ahead of time. Enclosed you will find detailed
information about these offerings. We value your loyalty as a Shareholder, and appreciate your banking
business as well. Please take advantage of these special rates, and pass the information along to your
friends and family members.
As always, the most significant driver of our success is the commitment we make to delivering a
differentiated service experience to our clients. As the competition in the banking industry continues to
grow even more intense, I want you to know how grateful we are for your support. I’m looking forward to
continuing the momentum we’ve had in the beginning of 2018 through the remainder of the year.
Very truly yours,

Gregory M. Evans
President and CEO
