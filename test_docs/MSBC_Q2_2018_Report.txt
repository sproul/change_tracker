Financial Highlights June 30, 2018

Bakersfield, California, July 30, 2018 -- Mission Bancorp (“Mission” or “the Company”), (OTC Pink:
MSBC), a bank holding company and parent of Mission Bank (the “Bank”), reported unaudited net
income available to common shareholders of $3.0 million, or $1.70 per basic common share, for the
second quarter of 2018, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 million, or
$0.91 per basic common share, for the second quarter of 2017. The second quarter of 2018 is the 77th
consecutive quarter of profitability for the Bank.
Net income for the second quarter of 2018 increased by 88.4% to $3.0 million, as compared to the
quarter ended June 30, 2017. A 54.2% increase in pre-tax income, combined with the reduction of our
effective tax rate due to the newly enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Trump Tax Cut”) resulted in a
significant increase in net income for the second quarter of 2018, compared to the same prior year
period. The reduction of the Federal corporate income tax rate due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act resulted in a 32.1% decline in our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018,
compared to the second quarter of 2017.
During the second quarter of 2018, pre-tax income growth was driven by strong revenue growth, which
continued to significantly outpace non-interest expense growth, on a year over year comparative basis.
Revenue growth was propelled by a 26.6% increase in net interest income, and a 45.7% increase in noninterest income (net of the portion attributable to minority interests) for the second quarter of 2018,
compared to the same prior year period. Non-interest expense grew by less than half the pace of
revenue at 13.2% on a year-over-year basis. Net interest income growth was attributable to growth in
average loans and net interest margin expansion. Non-interest income increased primarily due to a gain
on sale associated with the sale of the Bank’s Shafter branch building owned by Double W, LLC, a 50%
owned subsidiary of Mission Bancorp. Approximately half of the gain on sale was deferred and will be
realized over the term of the lease-back period of the building from the new owner in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Non-interest expense increased on a year over year basis, in
part due to the hiring of personnel such as a key executive officer, and to our new Ventura, California
loan production office, which opened late in 2017, and recently was converted into a full-service
business banking center.
“Mission continues to produce strong earnings growth due to growth in core relationships, which
resulted in a return to our shareholders of over 20% for the first half of 2018,” said A.J. Antongiovanni,
Mission’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Antongiovanni continued, “We have had
tremendous success in our new Ventura market since opening a loan production office in late 2017 and,
just five months after opening for business, we converted our office into a full-service branch.”

The Company’s return on average assets was 1.78%, for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018,
compared to 1.04% for the same prior year period. The Company’s return on average equity increased
to 20.92%, for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018, up from 12.80% for the second quarter of 2017.
Gross loans increased by $33.0 million during the second quarter of 2018 to $513.0 million and grew by
$84.3 million, or 19.7% on a year over year basis.
Mission’s total deposits decreased by $1.8 million during the second quarter to $605.2 million at
June 30, 2018, and increased by $74.4 million, or 14.0%, compared to the same prior year period.
Mission Bank’s non-interest bearing deposits represented 53.1% of its total deposits at the end of the
second quarter of 2018. Total assets grew by 15.0% to $681.5 million at June 30, 2018 compared to
$592.8 million at June 30, 2017.
Shareholders’ equity increased $8.1 million, or 16.0% to $58.7 million at June 30, 2018 compared to
$50.6 million at June 30, 2017. The increase in equity is due to strong earnings over the past year.
Compared to the second quarter of 2017, book value per share increased by $4.47, or 15.4%, to $33.42
per share.
Mission Bancorp is the parent holding company of four wholly owned subsidiaries, Mission Bank,
Mission Bank 1031 Exchange, LLC, Mission Community Development, LLC, and Nosbig 88, Inc. as well as
a 50% owner of Double W, LLC. Mission Bancorp is headquartered in Bakersfield, California and has
