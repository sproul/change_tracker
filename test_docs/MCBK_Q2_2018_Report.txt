Madison County Financial, Inc.
Reports Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results
MADISON, Nebraska, August 1, 2018. Madison County Financial, Inc. (OTC Pink: MCBK)
(“Company”), the parent holding company of Madison County Bank (“Bank”), today announced its
results of operations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
The Company's net income for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $1.5 million or $0.53 per
diluted share, compared to net income of $1.1 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the same period in
2017. The increase in net income included a $0.3 million increase in income before taxes and a
$0.05 million reduction in income tax expense. The Company's net income for the six months ended
June 30, 2018 was $2.8 million or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.2 million or
$0.78 per diluted share for the same period in 2017. The increase in net income included a $0.5
million increase in income before taxes and a $0.2 million reduction in income tax expense. On
December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation through the “Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act Bill of 2017”, which significantly changed the existing U. S. tax laws, including a reduction in the
corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as other changes.
Total assets increased $7.0 million to $396.3 million at June 30, 2018, compared to $389.3 million at
December 31, 2017, resulting from increases in investment securities classified as available for sale
and net loans, offset in part by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents.
As of June 30, 2018, there were 2,848,521 issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, and at August 1, 2018, the number of issued and outstanding shares of
common stock remained at 2,848,521. The Bank was considered well-capitalized under applicable
federal regulatory capital guidelines at June 30, 2018.
